# howto-camps

We like to go on big hacker camps, like SHA2017, CCC Summer Camp etc.

When going to such a camp there are some things that make life MUCH easier.

This repository is intended to help you get your things ready, so we provide
a few checklist, which may inspire you to remember things.

The Generic Camp checklist is generic-checklist.md and would be a good starting point.

There are also a couple of examples of "real checklists" I have used, and since
for instance BornHack repeats every year, I re-use and expand that one.

So have fun, and let me know if you think something should be added.

If you ARE going to a camp where I am, you are welcome to come borrow tools etc.
- so check in with me, I usually have soldering iron and stuff like that.
