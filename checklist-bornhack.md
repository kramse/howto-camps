## Description

This is a check list for things to bring if going to hacker camps. You do NOT need all of this, and it is a personal list for Henrik Kramselund. I have decided to use my personal list as it will be updated every time I go to BornHack then :-D

The list will be suitable for a medium sized camp, with a common village tent, a kitchen area and some infrastructure - power and networking.

If you are coming to BornHack you may be able to borrow stuff like tools from my camp when you need it, so don't bring it :-D
