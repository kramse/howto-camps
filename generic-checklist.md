# Generic Camp Checklist

Built upon HLK Camp checklist
Not everything is needed, but if you have space and want to have the most fun. Bring it :-)

## Tent and camping

## Network and infrastructure
- [ ] Power cables, with the right connector, schuko might the recommended for most places in EU now
