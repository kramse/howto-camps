# Doing a village at hacker camps

So this is my misc tips and tricks for doing a village tent at a hacker camp.

Use share and feel free to submit pull requests with your best tips.

## Introduction

What is a village?
A village is described nicely on the BornHack web page, so lets use that

> If this is your first hackercamp the term 'Village' might be confusing but it is fairly simple: a village is just a spot on the campsite where you and a bunch of your friends/likeminded people camp together. Apart from peoples individual tents which they sleep in, many villages bring a large common tent where you can hack and hang out during the day. It is also possible to rent a tent, chairs and tables in the shop!

Also BornHack is a very newcomer friendly camp with 100s which might be easier to comprehend, before going to the BIG camps like HAR2009, OHM2013, CCC camps etc. with thousands of attendees.

My first big hacker camp was HAR2009 but as I start this document I am sitting at the 17th TheCamp.dk Open Source summer camp, and we have just built our part of the camp yesterday.

I will try to list this in the order of what to bring, how to setup, and general advice.

# Bring stuff

This part is about what we bring. Making a village often needs at least one car for transporting stuff. We easily fill up a small van for a 10-15 person camp.

Dont forget to bring thrash bags!

## Which tents to bring

Bring or rent a tent, and when deciding which size, go a bit bigger.

The tent you use will be your home, workspace, lab and lounge for maybe a week. You want to be able to concentrate while the rest of the camp has fun at the other end, so moving your chair to a quieter corner is optimal.

Another thing to keep in mind is to have room for new friends. You should visit other camps and you can invite others into your camp and make friends. I often keep a chair free right next to mine, and have enjoyed having guests sit down for a chat and learning from each other.

Pro tip: if you have enough room then you might want to have lounge and guest area closer to the exit, and keep a part of the tent for "village people only" so kitchen, food, drinks, laptops and expensive things are more "secure".

Pro tip: having good containers for your stuff will help transport, but also when doing build-up and teardown - which may be in rain!

Besides the hack tent, you will probably also need to sleep and our preferred setup includes one hack tent - which may be an "event shelter" and then living tents in a circle outside.

Combining the two in a tent and awning is also a great way to kickstart a small village.


## Bring power stuff

Bring power cables, lots. Power source might be 25m or more away from your tent. Buying at least one cable drum of good quality is highly recommended.

Pro tip: getting the first power in your tent grounded by using the correct uplink plug is highly recommended, also for the Ethernet switch.

The event will probably have an info page about the plugs used. CEE plugs, 16A/32A might be available - check before going as you probably need to make a reservation.

If you have a big village then getting a bigger power distribution thingie, like the one used at construction sites may be a good idea.

(sorry link in danish, and may break of course)

Also it is to be expected that nearby tents might want to share your power, especially if you got a big plug from the event power team.

Pro tip: Keep power cables dry! We bought boxes designed for this, so you can put the connections inside the box, and close it.

Bring power strips, yes - lots and lots. We buy ones with 10 plugs, and fill them up quickly. Everything needs power these days, so extra extra.

Pro tip: put your name on the power strips you bring, then you can make even more friends by letting a neighbor hacker village use one, until they find time to go to shops and buy one.

Bring lighting, both for fun - but certainly also to be able to see. We use big white led light enclosures rated for outside use.

# Bring network infrastructure

Bring a loooooong Ethernet cable. I have bought a couple of 30m cables and they can be found pretty cheap.

Pro tip: if you buy extras then you can make friends buy letting others use one, or sell them off to nearby camps.

Bring a sturdy metal case Ethernet switch with enough ports. I prefer metal case one with built-in power supply and C13/C14 plug with the right cable ensures grounding for your Ethernet uplink.

Fact, your cable will lie on the ground for a week, so it might break - this is a fact, and usually not someone deliberately breaing it.

- [ ] ~~Test Access Point~~ nope, never - dont bring wireless equipment to camps which provide some wireless! Read https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Network/Rogue_Access_Points

# Bring furniture and camping equipment

You need to relax, so make sure you have a nice comfy setup by bringing furniture, carpets are also a good way to relax.

Pro tip: dont bring big and heavy furniture like couches, camping chairs today are excellent and much easier to transport.

Things we bring are:
* Chairs, camping style
* Camping tables, foldable
* Sleeping mats
* Sleeping bag

Pro tip: Buy good quality re-usable self-inflating mats. I have one 195 x 63 x 5 cm (LxWxH) < 2kg and a bigger one 195 x 130 x 7.5 cm (LxWxH) which is around 5kg I think.

Pro tip: dont buy the cheapest PVC matress which break halfway through camp and will go directly to the land-fill after one week of use :-( They are not designed for heavy use on grass and break easily.

Pro tip: renting a tent from the event with tables are a great way to get your village up and running quickly. You can put all your gear inside if it rains and avoid the panic. Note: we prefer to bring chairs, as some of the chairs you rent are less comfy than a camping chair you bring YMMV. Also camping chairs are designed for and work better on grass.

# Build up

Yay, you have arrived and are ready to build the best village!

First, bring in all your stuff, put it in a pile, but you can make life easier if you sort it a bit, so keep camping stuff like tents on the outside, so you can put them up without having to dig deep into the pile.

Then start building the village from the center, hacking tent first, then make a quick plan for the living tents.

First things first, start a thrash bag and a place to put empty cans/bottles.

Pro tip: make sure to have an entrance, and if you have some marking/warning tape like "police line" it can be a good way to avoid a maze to get in and out of your village.

Especially if you plan on having workshops you should make it easy for people to find your village.

While marking off a path may seem excessive and land grabbing, but let me try to explain. If you are a 10-15 person camp your neighbors will appreciate you using a single path than walking through YOUR camp all the time. Others can also put their tent entrance towards this path, and you will all benefit by being able to put tents side by side.

... or you can just allow chaos to reign, that is fine too of course :-)

Next step is the infrastructure, do this before you put up furniture. Pull the power cables, plan where to put the power strips. Do a tree-like structure will make it easier WHEN you re-route power, which will happen.

Pro tip: put lights on a few strips, or better on a single power strip with a switch, so the last person going to bed can flip a single switch.

Pro tip: write your name on strips, we often have a pile of power strips and take the one which suits the use best. Then at the end of camp, we can sort them and everyone takes their own back home.

In general take care with power, putting powerstrips on the ground is usually bad so hang them from tent etc. We have found that putting cables high and letting them drop down on the middle of the tables is a good way to cable stuff.

Same with Ethernet cables, put them high and let them drop down where needed.

# Teardown

Not much here yet, just dont be a dick, dont leave a mess.

Pro tip: take your thrash away multiple times during camp. Event staff will be better able to handle smaller amounts than HUGE amounts of thrash at the end.

The grass will of course be flat due to tents, but there is _NO EXCUSE_ to leave cigaret butts and thrash lying around at the camp site. You will make the event staff spend time doing this - after they spent literally months planning and then doing the camp.
